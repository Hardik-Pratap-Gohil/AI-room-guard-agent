## 💻 System Requirements

### Hardware
- 🎥 Webcam (720p or higher recommended)
- 🎤 Microphone (built-in or external)
- 🔊 Speakers or headphones
- 💾 RAM: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- 🖥️ CPU: Multi-core processor (Intel i5 or equivalent)

### Software
- 🐍 Python 3.13
- 🌐 Internet connection (for speech recognition and LLM API)
- 🖥️ Operating System: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.14+, or Linux

---

## 📦 Installation

### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** On Windows, dlib is installed automatically from a pre-built wheel. On Linux/macOS, install system dependencies first:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-dev cmake portaudio19-dev
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install cmake portaudio
```

### Step 2: Get Gemini API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Set environment variable:

```bash
# Windows
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Linux/macOS
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "import face_recognition; print('✓ Face recognition ready')"
python -c "import speech_recognition; print('✓ Speech recognition ready')"
python -c "import cv2; print('✓ OpenCV ready')"
```

## 🎮 Usage

### First-Time Setup

1. **Enroll Yourself**
   ```
   Say: "Enroll"
   System: "Please say the name of the person to enroll."
   Say: "John Smith"
   [System captures 6 photos automatically with pose guidance]
   ```

2. **Activate Guard Mode**
   ```
   Say: "Guard mode on"
   [System starts monitoring]
   ```

3. **Test Recognition**
   - Stand in front of camera
   - System recognizes you: "Welcome back, John Smith!"
   - Can chat with the guard
   - Say "bye" to exit conversation

4. **Test Intruder Detection**
   - Have someone else approach
   - System starts interrogation
   - Observe escalation behavior

5. **Deactivate**
   ```
   Say: "Guard mode off"
   ```

## 🎤 Voice Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **"Enroll"** | Start enrollment process for new trusted person |
| **"Guard mode on"** | Activate room monitoring |
| **"Guard mode off"** | Deactivate monitoring and return to idle |
| **"Bye"** / **"Goodbye"** | Exit trusted conversation mode |
| **Press 'q'** | Quit video window (also deactivates guard) |
| **Ctrl+C** | Emergency shutdown |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Microphone Not Detected
```bash
# Check available microphones
python -c "import speech_recognition as sr; print(sr.Microphone.list_microphone_names())"
```
**Solution:** Grant microphone permissions to Terminal/Python

### Cannot Open Webcam
**Solution:** 
- Close other applications using webcam (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
- Grant camera permissions
- Try different camera index in code (0, 1, 2)

### Speech Recognition Errors
**Solution:**
- Check internet connection (Google Speech API requires internet)
- Speak clearly with pauses between commands
- Reduce background noise
- Adjust `energy_threshold` in `EnhancedSpeechRecognition.py`

### LLM Not Responding
**Solution:**
- Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check API status at [Google AI](https://ai.google.dev/)
- System falls back to rule-based responses if LLM unavailable

### Face Recognition Too Sensitive/Lenient
**Solution:** Adjust threshold in `main_guard_system.py`:
```python
RECOGNITION_THRESHOLD = 0.4  # Lower = stricter (try 0.35)
                             # Higher = lenient (try 0.5)
```
